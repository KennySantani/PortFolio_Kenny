					After his draw with Fabiano Caruana, Praggnanandhaa was asked what he planned to do on the rest day. </h2>
					<p class="info">
					“I’ll be resting,” he said, with a look of mild surprise at the thought that anyone could imagine that he would spend the additional day doing anything else.Before they left for Toronto to compete at the biggest tournament of the year, Viswanathan Anand hosted four of India’s five Candidates contenders at his home over dinner. There, five-time world champion Anand reached into his memories of playing at big-ticket events like the Candidates to offer insights. “There is no greater joy on earth than winning before a rest day,” he declared at one point.

					It’s a feeling that none of the five Indians at the Candidates are experiencing as the tournament reaches its second rest day. R Praggnanandhaa is probably the most satisfied out of the Indian quintet, after playing out a calm draw with Fabiano Caruana, the top-ranked player in the eight-man field and a fifth-time participant at the high-stakes event. Vidit Gujrathi might have mixed feelings, having stemmed the sequence of defeats with a win and a draw heading into the rest day, even if the latter came against rank outsider Nijat Abasov. On the women’s side, while R Vaishali lost to Lei Tingjie and Koneru Humpy agreed to a draw with Anna Muzychuk, both the Indians are at the bottom of the standings at the halfway mark. But it’s the youngest among the five, Gukesh, who will be the most restless after blundering away his advantage against Alireza Firouzja due to time pressure. Gukesh’s defeat after holding an advantageous position for most of the evening prevented him from sitting on top of the open standings after the first half of the tournament.

					Incidentally, at the dinner he hosted for the Indian Candidates, Anand had lobbed a hypothetical question at the quartet: ‘what do you hate most? Losing (on any other day) or losing right before a rest day at a competition?’

						<p class="info">Virat Kohli chats with Nita Ambani, heads to Mumbai Indians dressing room to meet Rohit Sharma after RCB's 5th IPL loss.Virat Kohli was seen speaking to Mrs. Ambani and former Mumbai Indians captain Rohit Sharma after RCB slumped to their 5th defeat of IPL 2024.Between Mumbai Indians and the Royal Challengers Bengaluru, only one team's fortunes seem to be changing. Following back-to-back wins, MI have finally moved up from the bottom of the points table to be currently placed 7th, while there's no end to RCB's woes. With yet another defeat – their fifth of the season – it may already be too late for the three-time IPL finalists. Despite boasting a star-studded line-up, RCB have once again under-performed, with Glenn Maxwell, Faf du Plessis and Mohammed Siraj blowing cold more than hot.
						If there was a team whom RCB could beat to get back to winning ways, it was MI. The five-time champions, having lost their first three matches of the season, was right there for RCB's picking, but the way they were outplayed – MI chased down 197 inside 16 overs for a commanding win. The only shining light for RCB is Virat Kohli, who leads the Orange Cap list with 319 runs including two fifties and a century. His strike-rate may have attracted attention – good or bad – but Kohli continues to do Kohli things even if it's not enough to lift RCB out of doldrums

						<p class="info">Citing ‘problems’ that have ‘partly crippled’ her, Mary Kom resigned as the Chef de Mission of India’s contingent on Friday. Her decision comes weeks after the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) chose the boxing legend for the post.

						In a letter to IOA President PT Usha, the Union Sports Ministry and the Sports Authority of India, the London Olympics bronze medallist said: “It is embarrassing for me to retreat from a pronounced commitment, which I seldom do, but I am left with no choice.”

						The IOA, on March 21, announced contingent officials for the Paris Olympics, which begin on July 26. While Mary was chosen as the chef de mission, winter Olympian Shiva Keshavan was named her deputy.

						While accepting her resignation, Usha said in a statement that the IOA would ‘respect her decision and her privacy’. “I shall make the appropriate consultations and soon make an announcement about the replacement for Mary Kom,” Usha added.

						Mary’s decision leaves the IOA in a precarious position. While a majority of countries named their contingent leaders well in advance, India – in the absence of a formal appointment – has been represented in the Chef de Mission meetings by individuals with no prior Olympic experience.
